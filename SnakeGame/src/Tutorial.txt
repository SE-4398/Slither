Just like the classic snake game. Move the snake around, eat the sprites and score points. 
But there's a twist, There are also some mobs that can cause harm to the snake. Here's a list 
of the good and bad sprites in the game, but it's up to you to figure out which are which.
Good luck!

Good Sprites:
Mouse - *Regular food (Snake grows by 1 and gains 1 point)

Bird - *length-shortening food (snake looses length by 2 nodes)

Cow - *Super food (Snake grows by 1 and gains 5 points)

Ruby - *Super Rare food (Snake doesn't grow and gains 10 points)

Bad Sprites:
Poison Mouse - *Insta-Kill food (Snake dies, resulting in a game over)

Mongoose - It will actively hunt the snakes head to eat it. If it gets the head
           the snake gets a game over, but if the snake causes the Mongoose
           to run into its body, the Mongoose will get "knocked out" and play
           its death animation.

Big Bird - Will try to land around snake. If the snake
           runs into it, they get a game over.

Bomb Turtle - It will slowly walk towards an obstacle that is randomly chosen.
              If the snake runs into it, it'll explode and the player will get
              a game over. The explosion of the bomb Turtle should cover a small
              area around it. Say if the playing field is implemented as a square
              grid, the explosion will cover an 3x3 grid with the turtle in the
              middle. Feature can be scraped if it breaks something.
