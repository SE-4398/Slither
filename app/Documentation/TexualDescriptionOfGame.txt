Structuor of the game

The game is composed of several file : src, scenes, objects, assets, dist.
The entry point of the game is game.ts that calls on and runs the scenes
in the scenes file. These scenes call upon each other and may run in
parallel. These scenes then create the objects defined in the onjects
file for uses during the game. All of this code is then bundled via 
webpack into a single Javascript file called bundle.js that is placed 
inside the dist folder to be read by the html file.

No major algorithms critical for the systems behavior has been implemented
with in the game. 

The Phaser 3 framwork was used in creating the gamse as is.
