<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Slither is a web-based, replication of the common video game concept where a player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. In this rendition, additional obstacles have been randomly placed. Slither provides customizations which include snake color and background.
